      <h2>CHEER Group</h2>
      <p>CHEER Group consists of families caring for an adult with higher functioning intellectual disabilities. We pool our resources to share in hiring support workers on a 4:1 ratio.</p>
      <p>We have the beautiful facilities of Rock Glen Family Resort at our fingertips. This includes an indoor pool, sauna, fitness center, hall, and kitchen. Some of our projects are integrated with the wider community and there are planned special outings each month. <p>
        </p>We focus on building life skills, social skills, and leisure skills. We aim to build as much community inclusion as possible with a focus on the “normal”. Attendees must be able to look after their own self-care needs.</p>
