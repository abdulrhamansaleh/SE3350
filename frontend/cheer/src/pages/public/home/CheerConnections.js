      <h2>CHEER Connections</h2>
      <p>Cheer Connections is a group of parents and caregivers, we are all in a similar situation, knowing someone who has a form of disability.</p>
      <p>We meet at least once a month to offer each other support and share our knowledge. Our monthly meetings have been funded by the Ontario Caregivers Association, which provided a relaxing day, a nice lunch, and great guest speakers.</p>
      <p>This group helps reduce
isolation for caregivers as
well. It is a requirement of
the CHEER Group that
family members become
involved with Cheer
Connections.</p>
